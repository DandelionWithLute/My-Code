What is the .MD extension
md file extension (also written as . markdown) stands for “Markdown documentation”. Markdown is a lightweight markup language, and each MD file is written in a particular “flavor” of Markdown. It can be helpful to think of the different flavors as being like different dialects of one language.Nov 30, 2022
